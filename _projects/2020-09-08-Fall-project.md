Barbara’s Broken Heart Series came out of a period of her life where she continued to express herself through art and multimedia. The pieces of glass came to be included in the design as she was inspired after a texas rain storm knocked down a big oak tree in her back yard, and crashed on her outdoor glass table. Her daughter came out and said “mom, come see something. Don’t be upset, but the table shattered.” The first thing she said was “imagine all the things I can make with the glass!” 

Her vision aligns with her constant natural state of always looking for the art and opportunity to create in every day occurrences.
